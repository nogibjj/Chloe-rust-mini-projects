# Chat application
I built a chat app that could be used on a real server and can be access through the console.

# How to play
- Get two split view of two terminals and being in each repository, **server** and **client**.

- Execute each program by `cargo run`

- Quit the chat app by typing `:quit` on client terminal console.
