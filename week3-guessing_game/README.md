# Guessing game using Rust
Hereâ€™s how it works: the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message with the number of guessing time and exit.

# Execution

- To run, `cargo run`
- Enter a randome integer between 1 and 100
    - e.g. Please input your guess.
           `67`
- The expected output will be
```
